THIS REPOSITORY CONTATINS THE ALGORITHMS EXPLAINED IN THE WORK<br />
Cosentino, Oberhauser, Abate<br />
"A randomized algorithm to reduce the support of discrete measures "<br />
---------------------------------------------------

-The ipython notebooks contain the experiments to be run<br />
-recombination.py is the library with all the necessary functions,<br />

Some general notes:<br />
-The name of the ipynb files refers directly to the experiment in the cited work.<br />
-The last cells of the notebooks produce the pictures of the pdf.<br />
-To reduce the running time the parameters can be easiliy changed, e.g. decreasing N, n or sample.<br />

---------------------------------------------------
Library - recombination.py
---------------------------------------------------
It contains the algorithms relative to the reduction of the measure presented in this work,<br />
see the pdf for more details. In recombination.py we have rewritten in Python the algorithm presented<br />
in Tchernychova, Lyons "Caratheodory cubature measures", PhD thesis, University of Oxford, 2016.<br />
Note that we do not consider their studies relative to different trees/data structure,<br />
due to numerical instability in some cases as declared in the work; another<br />
reason is that their analysis was focused for specific cases. See the reference for more details.<br />
